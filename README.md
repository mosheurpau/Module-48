# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

---

### Special Notes

1. To install recharts run:

```
npm install recharts --force
```

2. If you see the following warning, ignore it for now.

`Warning: ReactDOM.render is no longer supported in React 18. Use createRoot instead. Until you switch to the new API, your app will behave as if it's running React 17. Learn more: https://reactjs.org/link/switch-to-createroot`

3. For the dashboard, you can modify the data provided in `data.json` and you can load the data the way you want.
4. [optional] To display ratings, you can use font-awesome stars or you can use react ratings website [class component might make it confusing] [react rating github](https://github.com/dreyescat/react-rating)

[react rating demo](https://dreyescat.github.io/react-rating/)

```
npm install --save react-rating
```

```
install font-awesome for react
```

```
import Rating from 'react-rating';
import { faStar } from '@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons'
import { FontAwesomeIcon } from "@fortawesome/react-fontawesome";

<Rating
    initialRating={3.5}
    emptySymbol={<FontAwesomeIcon icon={faStar} />}
    fullSymbol={<FontAwesomeIcon style={{color: 'goldenrod'}} icon={faStar} />}
    readonly
></Rating>
```

Please note, you will see an warning while using react rarting
`react-dom.development.js:86 Warning: Using UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps in strict mode is not recommended and may indicate bugs in your code. See https://reactjs.org/link/unsafe-component-lifecycles for details.`

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
